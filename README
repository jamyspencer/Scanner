I am implementing option 3 (FSA)

The table is not directly a two dimensional array. It is an array of Objects -- states[] in Scanner.h,
Scanner.cpp The objects are polymorphic, using a Protocol Oriented Programming design.
The object contains an array of lamdas -- driver[] So the table itself contains the driver. These
objects are defined in States.h, States.cpp.

There are 8 explicitly defined States that are relevant, the rest are handled with the null pointer.
To reduce the number of states stored at any one time I made the comment, greater than, less than and
bang states instantiated only when required. If this would be developed further I would create a timed
test to see any performance differences and possibly change this.
